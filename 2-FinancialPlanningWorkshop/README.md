# **Workshop for Cyber Budgeting**

It was a tremendous weekend, at Cactus Con 12 full of learning, networking, and fun. It was a distinct privilege to be a part of the first CISO-focused event at Cactus Con, oriented to support those who are interested in becoming a CISO, or who are in the role already and looking to sharpen their skills. A key part of the day, was a rotating science fair where groups of participants spent time at stations, where they refined skills such as budgeting, strategy, AI, business acumen, and metrics (_shout out to my friend Andy Jordan for the brilliant idea/leadership and the other key contributors + to Christine Wilson and Cactus Con for making this possible_).

For the station I moderated, we played a game that involved prioritizing some things to do, as well as looking at ways to get more accomplished using various strategies that I have seen work over the years. The game involves color-coded cards (below) that represent things you buy, projects you accomplish with people/processes, and cards that allow you to apply a strategy to increase your resources and get more accomplished.

Due to multiple requests to share the materials I used for the this game, I figured it would make the most sense to publish it out with instructions where it is available to anyone who may enjoy or benefit from it.

# Game Play

It all starts with a made-up company we call _Cactus Corp_. They are way behind the security curve and are basically starting from scratch. They have a relatively small team, so they can only do so much (use your imagination to fill in other details). As a starting point there is a budget of $800k to improve the security program, which you will see is not enough.

Start by selecting what you see as the highest value green cards, up to the limit of $800k (things you buy — green cards). Then select what you believe to be the top **three** people/process cards (yellow), and line them up on a whiteboard or flip chart paper mapping out a strategy (_write in any details you would like in the whitespace, as you map it out_). There are also purple blank cards to write in your own ideas for solutions — they can be a write-in for any card color.

Now, you have a start for securing _Cactus Corp_ and that is a good thing. No doubt, you also recognized that there were more things you wanted to do than the budget / card counts allowed. This is where the blue cards come into the picture. Select three blue cards, each representing a strategic action you can take to increase budget or headcount. The blue cards have either a dollar sign (**$**) or a “**P**” (for people/process), allowing for you to roll the dice to see how effective your action was at getting more money or support.

For dollar cards, add $100k to your starting budget for each number/point count on your dice roll. For the people/process oriented cards, you can add a headcount for each six dice points, allowing you to pick out another yellow card for each FTE you added.

Get creative — you can use the blank cards, to write in more solutions or adjust the game as needed to make it work for you, since I will not be there to moderate and serve as the DM/MC.

# Have fun!!

Note: You will need a printer, scissors to cut out the game cards, tape, and dice to roll. Also, this is not a game focused on having a winner and loser, it is about getting a group of people having meaningful conversations and risks, solutions, priorities, and how to get more resources to make their security program a success.

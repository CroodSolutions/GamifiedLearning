#Introduction / Executive Summary

This workshop we presented at the #CactusCon 13 #CISO Village, has been created to help guide participants through a workshop or gamified experience, to help create a security strategy.  How many of us have seen an organization spend insane amounts of money on things that shave away slivers of risk, while passing up opportunities to remediate the easiest issues and most fundamental problems?  Probably all of us who have been in the game for a while. 

It is our opinion that any organization that follows a few key steps, will have a significant reduction of risk:
•	Figure out who is likely to attack and research their usual tactics.

•	Consider what they will be after… What is important about your organization?
•	Identify and map out initial access vectors that could lead them to what they want. 
•	Imagine and research how (in detail) they are likely to attack.
•	Now, select specific likely scenarios and consider how each may play out. 
•	Contemplate controls, improvements, and response procedures that would disrupt such a flow (at each stage).
•	Consider the risk level reduced for each proposed improvement, weighed against the cost, difficulty, and user impact/productivity of making it happen. 
•	Prioritize accordingly and build your ideas into proposals, budgets, roadmaps, and aspirations.
•	Communicate these: an organization cannot fix a problem if they do not know about it or if they do not understand why it matters (advocate).   
•	Implement these improvements as part of an overarching strategy for improvement, aligned with change control and technology governance processes. 
•	Monitor and report on progress.  

#Gameplay / Exercise Structure

This exercise could be gamified and moderated using dice in a DnD style, or it could be delivered as more of a corporate workshop, using handouts, Post-It Notes, or whiteboards.  In either case, the idea is to walk through a real-world attack flow, and then map improvement ideas, in a way that educates and informs, while also helping to prioritize future actions and shape the vision.  If the former is selected, assign an experienced DM and build the provided scenarios into a “campaign” – if the latter, create cards and handouts and prepare to narrate the group through these discoveries.  

•	Frame the scenario using a fictitious (or real) organization.
•	Select an adversary likely to attack (insert your org here). 
•	Choose (or invent) an initial access vector. 
•	Identify and select post-exploitation cards that make sense for the scenario.
•	Assemble these into a high-level defense and response flow. 
•	Call out specific defenders who may be involved in this scenario.
•	Select from the defense cards and map them the specific attack flow you created.
•	Consider how budgets, vendor management, and overall program management will influence the success of this security project.  

#Disclaimer 
Scenarios and topics selected are far from exhaustive; instead, they are reflective of what we see commonly in the #ACTRA and #TISU threat intelligence communities.  While we created these exercises to inspire ideas and get participants thinking, if they are part of a security strategy session, supplement them with #MITRE ATT&CK, #CIS, applicable #NIST controls, or whatever applies to your specific use case.
